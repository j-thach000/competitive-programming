# structures
1. arrays
2. strings (although this is just an array with chars)

# techniques
1. two pointers
2. sliding window (best subarray, number of subarrays)
    -   number of subarrays that are strictly equal to a constraint 
    -   number of subarrays >=/<= to a constraint
3. prefix sum (summing subarrays)
4. string building
5. pre-processing (an investment of pre-computed data to use later on)
