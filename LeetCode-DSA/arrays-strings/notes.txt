# structures
1. arrays
2. strings (although this is just an array with chars)

# techniques
1. two pointers
2. sliding window
3. prefix sum (prefix refers to a subarray that begins at index 0, the beginning of the original array)
4. string building
5. pre-processing (an investment of pre-computed data to use later on)
